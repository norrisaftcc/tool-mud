I'll create an interactive presentation about how the CREATE system (The Forge) works in our game. This will be designed as an educational tool with neon styling to match our game's aesthetic:

I've created an interactive HTML presentation that teaches how the CREATE system (The Forge) works in our Neon D&D Isekai game. The presentation maintains our vibrant neon aesthetic while providing comprehensive information about the crafting mechanics.

The presentation includes 8 slides:

1. **Title Slide** - Introduction to The Forge
2. **Introduction** - Overview of the CREATE system and its importance
3. **Component Types** - Breakdown of the five component categories and examples
4. **Crafting Process** - Step-by-step walkthrough of how crafting works
5. **Recipe Examples** - Visual examples of recipes and their results
6. **Class-Specific Abilities** - How different classes interact with the crafting system
7. **Technical Implementation** - Code examples and system architecture for developers
8. **Educational Value** - How the system teaches creative problem-solving and technical skills

Key features of the presentation:

- **Visual Component System** - Icons and visual representations of crafting components
- **Interactive Examples** - Visual recipe combinations showing inputs and outputs
- **Quality Scale** - Visual representation of how dice rolls affect item quality
- **Code Examples** - Implementation details for developers
- **Educational Integration** - How the system connects to learning objectives

The presentation is fully navigable with Previous/Next buttons, keyboard arrow keys, or the spacebar. It includes a progress bar at the top to show location within the presentation.

This could be used by:
- Students learning how the game system works
- Teachers explaining the educational aspects
- Developers understanding the technical implementation
- Players wanting to master the crafting system

The design aligns perfectly with our neon aesthetic while providing clear, educational content about one of our four core game systems.
