## üé≤ INTRODUCTION

Welcome to **Neon D&D Isekai: Retro Realm Reboot**, a text-based RPG that transports players into a neon-soaked fantasy world that resembles classic D&D from the 1980s. The game blends the nostalgic mechanics of early Dungeons & Dragons with vibrant synthwave aesthetics and isekai anime tropes.

Players find themselves suddenly transported into this bizarre hybrid world where dungeon crawls are illuminated by neon lights, dragons breathe laser beams, and magic scrolls glow with digital text. The game maintains the simplicity of classic D&D rules while adding a modern isekai twist.
