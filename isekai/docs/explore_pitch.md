## ðŸ“Š Technical Architecture

### Dungeon Generation System

The dungeon generation system will create procedural layouts using a modified Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) algorithm:

```
+-------------------------+
| Dungeon Generator       |
|                         |
| 1. Create DungeonLevel  |
| 2. Partition Space      |
| 3. Place Rooms          |
| 4. Connect Rooms        |
| 5. Decorate with Props  |
| 6. Place Encounters     |
+-------------------------+
         |
         v
